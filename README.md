This project is to pratice and configure git with GCP resources
1. Reusable workflow teamplate which we can use in multiple workflows
Authentication workflow which is a template so we don't need to write authentication code everytime instead we can call Auth_reusable workflow
This will setup sdk and GCP setup to use "gcloud"
3. GitHub Action workflow to auth, build and push to Docker Hub
4. Github action workflow to auth gcp and sync git with GCp cloud storage
